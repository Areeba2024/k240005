Thinking: 

 The first histogram is horizontal, where each number is represented by a row of stars. The second histogram is vertical, where each number is shown in a column of stars, with the tallest columns at the top. For the vertical histogram, I first find the highest number and print stars from top to bottom, adjusting the number of stars based on max value.
