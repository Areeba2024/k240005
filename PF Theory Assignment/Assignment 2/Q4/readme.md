Thinking: 

In your code, I first take the input of multiple words from the user, storing them in an array. I then copy each word into another array (`copy_words`) for later manipulation so my original words dont get changed. The words are sorted within each word using a bubble sort to help identify anagrams later. In the end Igrouped the anagrams together by comparing the sorted versions of the words and printing them in groups.

Output:
